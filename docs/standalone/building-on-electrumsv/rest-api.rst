The REST API
============

ElectrumSV has a REST API. This is still a work in progress, but allows a range of interaction
with both wallets and accounts contained within them.

You can with some source code reading aptitude work this out for yourself in the meantime, others
are already using it. This documentation will be fleshed out as time allows.
