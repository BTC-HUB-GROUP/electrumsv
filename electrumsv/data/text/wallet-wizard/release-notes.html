        <ul>
            <li>Account script types: It is no longer possible to change the script type for an
                account, and only the safe default script type is usable for each kind of account.
                This prevents adventurous users from enabling advanced options.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trezor firmware: It should now be possible to sign transactions if a hardware wallet
                has been updated to the latest Trezor firmware. Trezor do not support Bitcoin SV,
                but we still want our users to be able to easily use them if they are already.
