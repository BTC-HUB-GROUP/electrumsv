            The most prominent changes are also summarised below for convenience, if you wish to read more
            about any given change, please read the linked article.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment dangers: The place where users enter where their payment goes to allows
                freeform entry of Bitcoin script assembly language. There was the possibility that
                users could paste in malformed addresses and have their payment go to an unexpected
                location. This should now be prevented.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transaction dialog: Some small interactive changes have been made to the
                transaction dialog. This allows a user to more easily inspect their wallet data
                and relate what coins were spent in one transaction to those received in another.
            </li>
            <li>
                REST API: The example REST API has received some changes and extensions to
                hopefully help those who want to use ElectrumSV as an automated wallet
                do so.
