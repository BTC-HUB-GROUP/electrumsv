        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>MacOS compatibility: When used in conjunction, both PyQt5 and PyInstaller which are used to
            provide our user interface and builds respectively, do not work on MacOS Big Sur. This is
            something to do with versions of PyQt5 later than 5.13.1, and so we have rolled back our
            required version of PyQt5 to 5.13.1.</li>
            <li>Transaction export:</li> The copy and save options in the transaction dialog, have been fixed and
            extended. There are now different options for both incomplete transactions and fully signed
            transactions, allowing export of transaction byte data, hex, and hex with proof data. At this
            time proof data is limited to parent transactions.</li>
            <li>Waiting dialog: This UI element shown when doing actions that may take some time, has been
            extended to optionally show a progress bar and remain open after the task has been completed
            for a given number of seconds unless the user manually dismisses it. This is used for
            transaction broadcast, transaction signing and copy/saving transactions with proof.</li>
        </ul>
