        <ul>
            <li>Trezor passphrases: Support for Trezor passphrase entry, which applies to all
                devices that have the passphrase setting enabled, was broken in 1.3.8.</li>
            <li>Trezor on device passphrase entry: The Trezor Model T device allows on
            device passphrase entry. Now ElectrumSV supports users opting to use this instead
            of entering the passphrase in ElectrumSV.</li>
            <li>Trezor/Keepkey passphrase confirmation: When creating an account for a Trezor
                or Keepkey hardware wallet, now it shows the proper confirmation dialog for
                passphrase entry, rather than the simple entry dialog.</li>
